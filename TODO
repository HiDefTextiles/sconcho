- add option for heavier lines every 10x10 boxes for 
  highlighting purposes
- allow selecting a group of legend items and move them
  together.
- allow to change font color.
- allow to resize pattern repeats
- more sophisticated import dialog for custom symbols
- fix svg export: currently it contains the symbols as bitmapped
  which is silly, not sure why
