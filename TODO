These are features that need to be implemented:

- allow to add new columns/rows. We should be more general and
  allow the addition of arbitrary cells at any position.

- allow to add cells inidividually or row/column wise.

- window showing all currently selected colors on the canvas
  with the ability to select all cells of a given color in bulk

- provide a keyboard interface to interact with the cursor on
  the canvas (or better the whole main window?)
