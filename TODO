- add option for heavier lines every 10x10 boxes for 
  highlighting purposes
- editable row labels
- at some point we should move to a new file format version
  to fix up some of the cruft that has build up over time
- allow selecting a group of legend items and move them
  together.
- allow to change font color.
- allow to resize pattern repeats
- more sophisticated import dialog for custom symbols
- fix svg export: currently it contains the symbols as bitmapped
  which is silly, not sure why
- allow to select which row/columns labels to show (to deal
  better with non-rectangular charts via hidden nostitches.
