These are some manual tests to ensure that all
symbols work and are displayed properly.

1) Start up sconcho. 

2) Create a new pattern grid with 12 rows and 15 columns

3) Insert several symbols from each of the categories
   (basic, 2,3,4,5,6 stitch cables, etc) by simple
   selection. Make sure that for multi-cell symbols
   these are placed properly.

4) Same a 3) but also choose different colors.

5) Insert several symbols from each of the categories
   (basic, 2,3,4,5,6 stitch cables, etc) by SHIFT-click
   selections:
 
     - insert complete rows and columns
     - insert with the rubber band

6) Redo and undo all that was done 10 times and make 
   sure that we end up at the same state in the end.

7) Make sure there are no duplicate symbols on the
   canvas (Ctrl-Alt-g)

8) Add several pattern repeat boxes and change the
   properties of each (line thickness and color)

9) Make sure legend items and pattern repeats can
   be moved and the motions can be undone/redone
   properly.
