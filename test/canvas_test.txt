These are some manual tests to ensure that all
symbols work and are displayed properly.

* Start up sconcho. 

* Create a new pattern grid with 12 rows and 15 columns

* Insert several symbols from each of the categories
  (basic, 2,3,4,5,6 stitch cables, etc) by simple
  selection. Make sure that for multi-cell symbols
  these are placed properly. Also ensure the legend
  tracks all new symbols (and removes old ones)
  including their color.

* Same a 3) but also choose different colors. Make
  sure that grabbing colors works.

* Make sure copy and pasting of stuff around works.

* Insert several symbols from each of the categories
  (basic, 2,3,4,5,6 stitch cables, etc) by SHIFT-click
  selections:
 
    - select complete rows and columns
    - select with the rubber band

* Redo and undo all that was done 10 times and make 
  sure that we end up at the same state in the end.

* Make sure there are no duplicate symbols on the
  canvas (Ctrl-Alt-g)

* Add several pattern repeat boxes and change the
  properties of each (line thickness and color)

* Make sure legend items and pattern repeats can
  be moved and the motions can be undone/redone
  properly.

* Make sure hiding legend, labels, canvas works properly.
