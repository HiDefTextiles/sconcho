These are some manual tests to ensure that adding
of custom knitting symbols works properly.

1) Add two custom knitting symbols of width 1 and 3
   using test_files/test_1.svg and test_files/test_2.svg.

2) Restart sconcho and make sure both new symbols are
   available and work.

3) Create a pattern including these symbols.

4) Make sure undo/redo works 10 times.

5) Check for duplicate symbols (Ctrl-Alt-g)

6) Update both custom symbols and make sure the new changes take
   effect properly.

7) Delete both custom symbols and make sure they are removed
   properly.
