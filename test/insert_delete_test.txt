These are some manual tests to ensure that 
deleting and inserting and rows and columns works fine.

A) ROWS
-------

1) Start up sconcho with file 

   test_delete_insert_rows_columns.spf

2) Delete and insert a number of rows. Make sure to delete
   and insert more than just single rows. Also use both the
   "below/above" and "at and below/above" toggles.

3) Make sure the limits for max rows is correct in 
   the "Manage Grid" GUI.

3) Make sure that undo and redo 10 times work fine

4) Make sure that there are no duplicate symbols on the
   canvas (Ctrl-Alt-g)


B) COLUMNS
----------

1) Close and start up another sconcho with

   test_delete_insert_rows_columns.spf

2) Delete and insert a number of columns. Make sure to delete
   and insert more than just single columns. Also make sure
   that sconcho properly rejects inserts or deletes that are
   impossible due to current layout. Also use both the
   "left of/right of" and "at/left of" toggles.

3) Make sure the limits for max columns is correct in 
   the "Manage Grid" GUI.

4) Make sure that undo and redo 10 times work fine

5) Make sure that there are no duplicate symbols on the
   canvas (Ctrl-Alt-g)
